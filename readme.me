Hello engineers!!

In order to run the program follow this steps:

1. type in the console "npm install" to install dependencies

2. the type "npm start"

Disclaimer:
I haven't done many servers so I followed the tutorial of MDN and it worked but
I might have added things that are not completely necessary for the program to run.

Also, not that it matters anymore, but I could've styled way better if i had more
time.
